## Description

For this project I had to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) API to use [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) to interact with a [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) database

The following animation shows the application's API Routes being tested in Insomnia Core to perform RESTful CRUD operations:
